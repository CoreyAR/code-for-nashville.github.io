    <h2>We Need More than Just Coders</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interested in Event Planning?</strong> We are always planning our next big event, so someone to help with the logistics will always be needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Interested in PR and Marketing?</strong> Help spread the word about our apps to the public. Facebook, Twitter, etc. If an app is fully developed and deployed, but there is no one to use it, does it make a sound?</li>

            <li><strong>Interested in Photography?</strong> We would love beautiful photos to include in our sites whether it is of our events or Nashville at large.</li>
            </li><strong>Interested in Design?</strong> Help make our apps look and feel beautiful. Design logos and layouts for our promotional materials. If you think some of our sites can use a makeover, send us your designs!</li>
        </ul>
